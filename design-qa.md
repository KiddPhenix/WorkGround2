# Design QA — 全局会话状态

- source visual truth path: `D:\Temp\codex-clipboard-4ae37805-8cc7-47b9-a37b-84e882eae597.png`
- implementation screenshot path: in-thread Windows Graphics Capture artifact `screenshot-0` from `D:\Work\WorkGround2\desktop\build\bin\WorkGround2-QA.exe`
- viewport: source crop `698 × 392`; implementation window `1488 × 935`
- state: dark theme; running `2` (including one CLI session); needs attention `2`; running list expanded; AddOn closed

## Full-view comparison evidence

The source crop and implementation capture were emitted together in one comparison input. The two global controls sit immediately left of the existing AddOn button and remain clear of the command and native window controls. The implementation preserves the existing workbench header height, dark surface, border, radius, and spacing tokens.

## Focused region comparison evidence

The source itself is a focused top-right crop. In the implementation capture, the matching top-right region shows:

- a separate `运行中 2` status with an amber dot;
- a single merged `待关注 2` button with the Sparkles icon;
- the existing AddOn button directly to their right;
- an inward-opening running-session list that does not collide with native window controls.

No additional crop was needed because the source is already a focused component reference and the implementation controls are legible at native scale.

## Findings

No actionable P0/P1/P2 differences.

- Fonts and typography: existing WorkGround2 UI font, 12 px control text, tabular count numerals, and compact weights are consistent with adjacent header controls.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: both controls are 32 px high, use the existing 8 px action gap, and align with AddOn.
- Colors and visual tokens: borders, background, text, warning accent, focus ring, and disabled opacity use existing semantic tokens.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: no raster imagery is involved; the Sparkles icon uses the existing Lucide icon library, while the running state uses a small semantic status dot.
- Copy and content: `运行中` and `待关注` match the requested language; the expanded list includes session title, workspace, CLI source, and relative run time.

## Interaction evidence

- Component test verifies running is hidden at zero, includes CLI sessions, and opens its list only from hover/focus state.
- Component test verifies attention excludes CLI sessions and jumps to the earliest attention timestamp.
- Native Wails capture verifies the default header state and expanded running list visually.

## Comparison history

- Pass 1: no P0/P1/P2 findings; no visual corrections required after comparison.

## Follow-up polish

- P3: the disabled `待关注 0` state is intentionally subdued; its contrast can be raised later if user testing finds it too quiet.

final result: passed
